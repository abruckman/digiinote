## About digiinote

Our team noticed a trend of circulating images on our cohortâ€™s Slack Channel that had various handwritten notes on whiteboards, post-its, and/or notebook paper that were impossible to keep track of. We integrated the Google Vision, Google Drive, and Google OAuth API to build a user-friendly application that digitizes handwritten notes.
